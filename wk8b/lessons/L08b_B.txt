Numerical differentiation: general finite differencing formula

forward
y'(k) = sum(C_{i} y(k+i),{i,0,N})/dx

backward
y'(k) = sum(C_{i} y(k+i),{i,-N,0})/dx

central
y'(k) = sum(C_{i} y(k+i),{i,-N/2,N/2})/dx

Where C_{i} is the coefficient of the ith term and is given by the algorithm we choose and the accuracy we desire

we need to have uniform step size i.e. dx is constant

general formulae for 2nd derivatives look similar

forward
y''(k) = sum(C_{i} y(k+i),{i,0,N})/dx^2

backward
y''(k) = sum(C_{i} y(k+i),{i,-N,0})/dx^2

central
y''(k) = sum(C_{i} y(k+i),{i,-N/2,N/2})/dx^2

note that the C_{i} terms will be different

we can look up the terms in a FD/BD (forward differentiation/backward differentiation) table.

* negative coefficients for BD only for odd derivatives

CD coefficients have a serparate table-these allow us to get the same accuracy with fewer terms. This is helpful in cases where we don't have a lot of data.
