Finding derivatives using numerical techniques. We look at operating on functions and on discrete empirical data.

Numerical differentiation

definition of a derivative dy/dx = lim(h->0) (y(x+h)-y(x))/h
numerically, we cannot let h->0 but we can make it very small
calculate the derivative at every point by sliding x and keeping h constant

3 Finite difference methods: forward, backward & central-may use all methods on a given
set of data

1) forward differentiation

y' ~ (y_{n+1}-y_{n})/(x_{n+1}-x_{n})

*cannot be used in real time

2) backward differentiation

y' ~ (y_{n}-y_{n-1})/(x_{n}-x_{n-1})

*can be used in real time

3) central differentiation-note that the point of interest isn't used

y' ~ (y_{n+1}-y_{n-1})/(x_{n+1}-x_{n-1})

*most accuracy per number of sample points
*cannot be done in real time
