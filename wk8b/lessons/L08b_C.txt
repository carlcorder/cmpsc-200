Numerical differentiation of data collected from an experiment

*data needs to be uniformly sampled
       -ways around this requirement include interpolation
*low sampling rate can give poor estimate
     -same as when we knew function
*avoid aliasing
*numerical derivative is not very accurate for a low sample rate

Accuracy is suscetible to 'noise' in the data
* experimental data will have noise
*higher sampling rates can worsen the problem
*the three methods we are looking at may perform poorly and it may be neccessary to use higher order methods
*can first filter the data to smooth noise
*integration not impacted as greatly by random noise
*using more points in the differentiation can help to mitigate the effects of the noise
