Linear Systems -> L07_A

* all variables are linear

* first degree, multivariable polynomials formed with addition and subtraction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Systems of Equations of Unique Solutions -> L07_B

* same number of linearly independent (LI) equations as unknowns

* having the same number of variables as unknows does note mean we have
  a solvable system, or that there will be a unique solution.

* in order to transcribe these equations into Matlab we must
  1) write the unknowns in the same order in every equation
  2) leave space for missing unknowns or explicitly write 0s
     we need matrix A to be square

* the whole point of doing this is to achieve matrix form (Ax = b)
  where the LHS (A) are the coefficients of the unknowns, and on the RHS
  x is a column vector of unknowns and b is a column vector of constants

* find the vector x such that Ax = b, for small systems substitution or elimination

* x = inv(A)*b -> matrix inverse (A must be square)
* x = rref([A b]) -> reduced row echelon
* x = A\b -> faster Gauss-Jordan elimination [A|b] ~ [I|x]
